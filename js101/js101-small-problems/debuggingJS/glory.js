/*
The issue lies in lines 22-29: the switch statement cases. When omitting the
`break` statement after a switch case, all the following switch cases get
executed, as well. Thus when the `result` in the `targetRoll` function is `1`
for example, all three cases of the switch statement are executed and the output
looks like this:
--> 1
Meagre attempt. Your character fails miserably.
Your character succeeds without effort. Glory!
Your character fails.

We can fix this issue by adding a `break` statement in each case.
